# 🍫 Interactive Chocolate Sales Dashboard | Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents an **interactive Chocolate Sales Dashboard** built using **Power BI** to analyze sales performance across time, products, and key business KPIs.

Although this project was inspired by a guided walkthrough, I independently:
- Redesigned the report layout  
- Customized tooltip interactions  
- Refined KPI visuals  

The focus was on improving **clarity, usability, and business insight communication**, rather than just following steps.
